	         <h3>The concept</h3>
	         <p> Our goal is to simplify students' lives while promoting healthy and affordable eating. Each week, a new basket is available, containing balanced and varied recipes for each day: two meals per day (lunch and dinner) for the entire week. The recipes are designed to be quick to prepare, with accessible and nutritious ingredients, keeping students' tight budgets in mind. Users can select their preferences, and the app takes care of creating a basket optimized to meet their needs.</p>
